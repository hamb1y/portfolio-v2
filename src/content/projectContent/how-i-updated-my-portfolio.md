# 1. Issues with previous site:

With my previous site, while it looked and functioned well to the end user 2 drawbacks were that i had to directly clone, edit the centralized config file, `src/config.ts` for modifying anything and had to manually write a `mdx` file using VSCode. This was inconvenient to do.

# 2. How I migrated my site

I decided that it would be a waste of my effort to fully rebuild my site from scratch, after trying to do it. So, instead I came up with a solution. I used DecapCMS (Previously Netlify CMS) for editing, as it has a robust, easy to use, and adaptable configuration system. For authentication, I chose Netlify Identity as it was simple, robust and easy to setup.

I started by first removing myself from Cloudflare's DNS system, and migrated back to the one my domain registrar - Porkbun, offered. Now I had full control on the DNS, I migrated the portfolio site from Vercel (a hosting provider), to Netlify (another hosting provider). This gave me easy access and integration with Netlify Identity and DecapCMS.

I also chose DecapCMS because it's UI was easy to use and simple. Then, I setup DecapCMS and Netlify Identity, and then I had them installed. Next, I properly configured DecapCMS to adapt to my site's structure, which was slightly challenging.

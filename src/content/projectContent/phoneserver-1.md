  How I converted my grandmother's old and broken phone into a (almost) fully

## NOTE: This project is defunct, and after further testing is unstable and does not work. Since you also don't havy any root access, good luck running docker or even putting something on port 443. Also, if you do root your phone, at that point you should just buy a homeserver since hardware like this is quite bad. You could buy a homeserver much better than this for 100 USD (~10k INR) and buy a real arm homeserver with root 

# Converting my Grandmother's Old, Broken phone into a server

So, around January of 2025 I gifted my grandmother a new phone, since her old one was laggy and it's touchscreen was broken However, the old phone worked perfectly fine so I decided to convert it to a linux server with Termux. Termux (not to be confused with terminal multiplexer tmux) is a linux terminal emulator built for android that allows you to use android tools such as nginx and java on an android phone through the CLI. So, here's how I converted my grandmother's phone to a webserver:

![Image of me connecting to the phone through ssh](/phoneserver-1.png)
 - Step 1: After getting the phone, I factory reset it and cleaned it as much as I could. After that, I installed the F-droid store and installed Shizuku, Canta and Termux. I started Shizuku by turning on developer mode and sending the adb command once connected to my computer. After that, Canta could remove most of the Samsung Bloat with Shizuku Access. I did that, then opened termux, installed dropbear and made a script to execute `dropbear -p 43000` so that I could connect to it through my laptop, thus making it much easier to configure and run.
 - Step 2: After connecting through ssh, I installed python, nodejs, git, nginx, neovim and figlet using the command `pkg update && pkg upgrade && pkg install python nodejs nvim git figlet nginx` (pkg is termux's package manager, based on apt). Then, I installed pnpm which is more disk and memory efficient using the command `npm install pnpm@latest --global`, which allowed me to use the pnpm command locally.
 - Step 3: After installing all the dependencies, I had 3 uses for the phoneserver.
    1. Host an FTP Server with some files
    2. Host 2 static astro.js sites
    3. Host the dynamic JNVCKM Site v2
 - Step 4: to do this, for the first one I asked Grok AI to build me a python webserver, then added some css to it and made a start script. To host the two astro.js sites, I did `cd && git clone https://github.com/hamb1y/portfolio && git clone https://github.com/hamb1y/orangesmp-website` to get both of these sites onto my server. Then I did `cd ~/portfolio && pnpm install && pnpm run astro build && pnpm run astro preview --host` to first go into the portfolio root directory, then install all the dependencies, then build the site, then run the site to test that it did in fact work. I did the same for both of the astro.js sites. Then, I made a startup script for both of those, which looks like this:
    1. Portfolio:

     `
        pkg update -y;
        pkg upgrade -y;
        pkg install git nodejs -y;
        npm install pnpm@latest --global;
        rm -rf ~/portfolio;
        git clone https://github.com/hamb1y/portfolio.git;
        cd ~/portfolio;
        pnpm install;
        pnpm run astro build;
        figlet "Server Started!";
        pnpm run astro preview --host;
     `
     
     2. OrangeSMP Website:

     `
        pkg update -y;
        pkg upgrade -y;
        pkg install git nodejs -y;
        npm install pnpm@latest --global;
        rm -rf ~/orangesmp-website;
        git clone https://github.com/hamb1y/orangesmp-website.git;
        cd ~/orangesmp-website;
        pnpm install;
        pnpm run astro build;
        figlet "Server Started!";
        pnpm run astro preview --host;
     `

 However, there are a few caveats which I found out later which made this almost uselss:
  - There's no root access, which makes everything much harder and different
  - It only support arm64 linux programs. While it's better than windows, many programs can't be used because of this.
  - **!IMPORTANT!** - Due to no root access, it becomes very difficult to port forward from here to the outside internet or a domain name. This made this phone almost entirely useless, and I had to find this out the hard way later.

# How I made my Portfolio Site
So, here's how I made my portfolio site:
I asked <a href="https://bolt.new">bolt.new</a> to make me a portfolio site using Astro.js and Plain CSS. This was meant to be easily debuggable and have high performance. After some tweaking and bug-fixing, I made the first draft of the site. Then, I improved upon it  by adding the Hobbies section, Featured Projects/Achievements, and fixing the colors for light mode. Then, I added different types of achievements and once again asked <a href="https://bolt.new">bolt.new</a> to change achievements.astro to sort the achievements for me.

However, this isn't just any site, because instead of painstakingly manually typing all my hobbies, achievements, projects etc., I made a centralized src/config.ts configuration file where almost everything about the site can be configured. After some more bugfixing, I added all the content and styles to my site only using src/config.ts and src/styles.css. After a while, the site is complete and this is what you see. The only thing other than the static pages not defined in the configuration file are the project mini-blogs, of which you're reading right now!

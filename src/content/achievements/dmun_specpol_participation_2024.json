  "description": "During the academic year of 2024/25, I entered into my first model United Nations competition, the Deens Model United Nations (DMUN) Special Political and Decolonisation Junior Committee (SPECPOL), and had we even managed to reach a resolution for the conflict within 2 days with a mostly mutual agreement. I also raised a query with the Speaker being biased towards the Representative of India. Overall, I think it broadened my scope on global politics, and helped me raise my voice against injustices.",

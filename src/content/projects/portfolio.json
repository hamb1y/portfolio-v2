Instead of regularly configuring it by typing out a bunch of stuff, there's a central src/config.ts file that does all that for me. All I have to do is type the configuration I want, and the changes happen appropiately. The only places where I need to do anything manually are the project/*.mdx files for projects without a different web-location.",

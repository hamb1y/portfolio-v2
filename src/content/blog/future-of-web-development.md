# The Future of Web Development

The web development landscape is constantly evolving. Let's explore the key trends shaping our industry.

## AI-Powered Development

AI tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT are changing how we write code. These assistants help with boilerplate, debugging, and even architecture decisions.

## Edge Computing

Moving computation closer to users reduces latency and improves performance. Edge functions and CDNs with compute capabilities are becoming standard.

## WebAssembly

WASM enables running languages like Rust, C++, and Go in the browser at near-native speeds, opening new possibilities for complex applications.

## Conclusion

Staying current with these trends helps developers build better, faster, and more secure applications for the modern web.

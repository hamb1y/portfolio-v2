# Getting Started with Astro

Astro is a modern static site builder that delivers lightning-fast performance with partial hydration.

## Why Astro?

Astro allows you to build websites with your favorite UI frameworks (React, Svelte, Vue, etc.) but ships zero JavaScript by default. This means faster page loads and better user experience.

## Key Features

- **Islands Architecture**: Only hydrate interactive components when needed
- **Framework Agnostic**: Use React, Svelte, Vue, or plain HTML/CSS/JS
- **Content Collections**: Type-safe content management with Markdown or MDX
- **Zero JS by Default**: Ship minimal JavaScript for better performance

## Getting Started

```bash
npm create astro@latest
```

Follow the prompts and start building!

## Conclusion

Astro is an excellent choice for content-focused websites, portfolios, and blogs where performance matters.
